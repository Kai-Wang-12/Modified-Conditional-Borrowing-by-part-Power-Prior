### Description
R codes to reproduce the results in the article: "Modified Conditional Borrowing-by-part Power Prior for the dynamic and parameter-specific information borrowing of Gaussian endpoint" by Kai Wang, Han Cao, Chen Yao. 


### Files and subfolders
*1  Folder "Code_for_SingleES" contains the R codes to reproduce the results of leveraging external Gaussian endpoint with 
      unknown variance from a single external control arm and the application.
*2  Folder "Code_for_MultipleECs" contains the R codes to reproduce the results of leveraging external Gaussian endpoint with 
      unknown variance from multiple (three) external control arms.


### Platform
